# How to use it

## RUN on Colab
we recommand to use it in a colab GPU notebook environment.

1. Open a colab GPU notebook.

2. Drag the three dataset folders in the data folder and notebooks into colab's file management system.


3. Modify the path to access data in the code according to the path where you store each data set.


4. Run the notebook.

## RUN on local PC
This repository is still under fixing. We are trying to convert colab notebooks to ipynb notebooks now.

Theoretically if you have a python3.9 environments with jupyter notebook, pytorch lightning, and drain3, it should work.
